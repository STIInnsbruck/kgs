## Abstract
Building and hosting a Knowledge Graph requires some effort and a lot of experience in semantic technologies. Turning this Knowledge Graph into a useful resource for problem solving requires even more effort. An important consideration is to provide cost-sensitive methods to build a Knowledge Graph that is a useful resource for various applications: “There are two main goals of Knowledge Graph refinement: (a) adding missing knowledge to the graph, i.e., completion, and (b) identifying wrong information in the graph, i.e. error detection.” [Paulheim, 2017] This tutorial is targeting the process from knowledge creation over knowledge hosting, knowledge curation to knowledge deployment – applied to a Knowledge Graph using schema.org and domain specific extensions of schema.org as an ontology. The tutorial will be based on a book the lecturers co-authored: “Knowledge Graphs – Methodology, Tools and Selected UseCases” [Fensel et al., 2020] and is an extended and adapted version of a tutorial the lecturers gave at [SEMANTICS2019](https://2019.semantics.cc/satellite-events/how-build-knowledge-graph).

## Organizers
The presenters are experienced PhD students with several publications in the field. They also actively participate in a industry-funded project, [MindLab](https://mindlab.ai), that aims to build a Knowledge Graph for the tourism domain to be consumed by conversational agents. Moreover, the presenters have teaching experience in the field, especially with courses like Semantic Web and Semantic Web Services.

The organizers are co-authors of the book "Knowledge Graphs - Methodology, Tools and Selected Use Cases" [(Fensel et al., 2020)](https://www.springer.com/de/book/9783030374389).
